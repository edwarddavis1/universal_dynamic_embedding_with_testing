# Flight and C5 Regulations

This repository contains code for analyzing flight data and C5 regulations in Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic. The code is written in Python and uses various libraries such as pandas, numpy, and pycountry.

## Getting Started

To run the code, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- pycountry

You can install these libraries using pip:

```pip install pandas numpy pycountry```

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can run the code by running the `flight_and_c5_regulations.py` file.

## Data

The data used in this analysis comes from various sources, including:

- Flight data from [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html)
- C5 regulations data from [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-data-response-measures-covid-19)

The flight data is stored in a CSV file called `airports.csv`, which contains information about airports around the world. The C5 regulations data is stored in a CSV file called `c5m_close_public_transport.csv`, which contains information about transport restrictions in various countries.
